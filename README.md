Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and model-building process for predicting diabetes outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes the diabetes.csv dataset, which includes several features related to patients' health indicators, to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

Project Overview
The project includes the following steps:

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Conducted initial data exploration to understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
Visualized the data using histograms, heatmaps, and box plots to identify potential correlations and outliers.
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for and confirmed the absence of missing values.
Detected and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model performance.
Feature Extraction and Data Splitting:

Extracted features and target variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio for model evaluation.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Built and evaluated several machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Compared models based on accuracy and ROC AUC scores.
Random Forest emerged as the best model, with 98% accuracy and 97% ROC AUC.
Conclusion and Future Work:

Random Forest was identified as the top-performing model.
Suggested future improvements, such as balancing the dataset and further tuning model parameters.

#Installation
